The differences between **in-memory persistence** and **real database persistence** were illustrated through examples using **Spring Data JPA** with **H2 (in-memory)** and **PostgreSQL (external database)**.

## **2025 / 05 / 12 - Introduction to Kubernetes and practical demo**

### Content Overview

In the theoretical overview, we explored the architecture and core concepts of Kubernetes, focusing on its role in automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Key elements such as the control plane, nodes, pods, deployments and services were discussed in relation to how Kubernetes maintains desired state and ensures high availability.

1. Kubernetes Basics: Overview of Kubernetes as a container orchestration platform, its control plane and worker node architecture.
2. Pods: Understanding the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes and their lifecycle.
3. Deployments: Declarative management of pod replicas, rolling updates, and self-healing mechanisms.
4. Services: Abstracting access to pods through stable network endpoints (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).

The second session focused on hands-on experience through a live demonstration. Students learned how to define and deploy applications using Kubernetes manifests, written in YAML. We created and explored the behavior of Pods, Deployments, and Services, highlighting their roles in workload management, scaling, and exposing applications.
Using kubectl, we interacted directly with the clusterâ€”applying manifests, inspecting resources, viewing logs, and debugging running containers.

- Creating Kubernetes Manifests - YAML Syntax and Structure: Crafting Kubernetes resource definitions in YAML.
- Interacting with the Cluster using kubectl
- Resource Management: Creating, updating, and deleting resources using kubectl apply, kubectl delete, and kubectl get.
