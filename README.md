![Brainstorming](/images/2025_03_17_brainstorm.png)

### **Content Overview**

1. **Distributed Systems**
   - Difference distributed and non-distributed systems
   - Reasons to use/implement distributed-systems
   - Categories of heterogenity and resilience
   - Role communication protocols, service registry, distributed configuration
   - The fallacies of distributed computing

2. **The NIST Cloud Definition (2011)**
   - Breakdown of the NISTâ€™s five essential cloud characteristics, deployment models, and service models. 

3. **Cloud Service/Abstraction Models**
   - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS revisited, with modern examples.
   - The evolution of abstraction models, including FaaS and Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS).

4. **Introduction to CNCF**
   - Role of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the cloud ecosystem.
   - CNCF Landscape: technologies, tools, and projects.

---

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
- Distinguish between distributed and non-distributed systems
- Explain the importance of heterogeneity and resilience as key drivers for distributed systems.
- Describe the NIST cloud definition and its significance in the modern cloud landscape.
- Identify the major cloud providers and tell about their evolution.
- Differentiate between cloud service models and discuss their evolution, including modern abstraction models like CaaS.

### **Student/Review Questions**
- What are the five essential characteristics of cloud computing according to NIST, and how do they apply to modern cloud services?
- Identify 3 main cloud providers and list their most important services
- What are the differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS? Give examples of each in today's cloud ecosystem.- What is the CNCF, and why is it important in the context of cloud-native technologies?
- Describe 3 of the fallacies of distributed computing
